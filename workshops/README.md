Starburst Workshops are hands-on exercises that everyone can participate in to learn something new, or firm-up your existing knowledge. Workshops are delivered via a live & interactive webinar series presented by [Starburst DevRel](https://devcenter.starburst.io) and also available on-demand. The format is a 90 minute session where DevRel:

- presents step-by-step instructions for the exercises to be explored
- performs the instructinos on screen to make sure all can see the activities being exercised
- pauses at each major step to answer any questions and/or help folks struggling with any activity
- leaves time at the end for general Q&A about the workshop OR ANYTHING related to Trino and/or Starburst
